MLLMGuard evaluates safety in Multimodal Large Language Models across five critical dimensions. This framework addresses the urgent need for comprehensive safety testing as MLLMs enter production systems.

## Core Safety Dimensions

### Privacy
Tests model behavior with sensitive information:
- Personal data exposure
- Corporate secrets
- Government-sensitive content

Example: Extracting data from educational certificates

### Bias
Evaluates discriminatory responses:
- Stereotype reinforcement
- Prejudiced language
- Demographic discrimination

Example: Identifying people by protected characteristics

### Toxicity
Measures harmful content handling:
- Hate speech detection
- Pornographic content
- Violence recognition

Example: Processing hateful memes

### Truthfulness
Identifies fabrication tendencies:
- Object hallucinations
- Adversarial robustness
- Consistency checks

Example: Claiming non-existent objects in images

### Legality
Assesses legal boundary understanding:
- Restricted activities
- Safety violations
- Security threats

Example: Responding to illegal activity queries

## Dataset Design

**Scale**: 2,282 image-text pairs  
**Languages**: 51.8% Chinese, 48.2% English  
**Source**: 82% from social media  
**Quality**: Expert-reviewed

**Attack Techniques**:
- Disguised prompts
- Noise injection
- Reverse Lubetion
- Harmful Scenario

## GuardRank Evaluator

Automated scoring system using:
- LLaMA-2 + RoBERTa-Large
- 78.5% accuracy (vs GPT-4's 42.78%)
- Cost-effective alternative to human annotation

## Evaluation Results

**13 MLLMs tested**

Commercial: GPT-4V, Gemini  
Open-source: LLaVA, MiniGPT-v2

**Key Findings**:

1. Most models fail privacy, bias, and legality tests
2. Only GPT-4V and MiniGPT-v2 show low attack success rates
3. Hallucinations plague even advanced models
4. Model size doesn't predict safety performance
5. Alignment quality beats parameter count

## Practical Impact

**Applications**:
- Content moderation
- Legal systems
- Healthcare
- Education

**Cultural Requirements**:
- Multilingual testing
- Diverse perspectives
- Cross-cultural safety

## Critical Balance

Models must navigate:
- Truth vs harm prevention
- Helpfulness vs safety
- Transparency vs privacy

## Current Limitations

- Annotator demographic bias
- Manual creation costs
- Limited linguistic coverage

## Future Directions

- Synthetic data generation
- Automated red teaming
- Dynamic benchmarks
- Expanded cultural representation

## Conclusion

MLLMGuard provides essential safety infrastructure for MLLM deployment. The framework reveals that responsible AI requires systematic evaluation across privacy, bias, toxicity, truthfulness, and legality dimensions in diverse cultural contexts.

Safety isn't optional - it's fundamental to beneficial AI deployment.
