Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can read images, text, time series, and audio all at once. They can spot findings in scans, summarize clinical notes, and track patient data over time. This review:

1. Explains why multimodal models matter  
2. Describes leading models in medical imaging  
3. Covers models for electronic health records  
4. Lists key clinical validation datasets  
5. Notes deployment challenges  
6. Suggests future directions

## 1. Why Multimodal AI Matters in Healthcare

Healthcare data comes in many forms

- Scans and slides: X rays, MRIs, CT scans, histology images  
- Clinical notes: admission and discharge summaries, progress notes  
- Time series: vital signs, lab trends, ECG waveforms  
- Audio: heart and lung sounds, patient interviews  

A single model that handles all these inputs can

- Detect subtle abnormalities in images  
- Summarize long reports in plain language  
- Integrate chart trends with clinical context  
- Support diagnosis and treatment planning

## 3. Language Models for Electronic Health Records

Models can also read and reason over clinical text and signals.

### 3.1 GatorTron

- **Size**: 110 M to 8.9 B parameters  
- **Corpus**: 82 B words of de-identified clinical text  
- **Tasks**: concept extraction, relation extraction, inference, question answering  
- **Finding**: larger models and more data boost all clinical NLP tasks  

### 3.2 Few-Shot Health Learners

- **Base**: PaLM-24 B pretrained on 780 B tokens  
- **Adaptation**: few-shot fine-tuning on time series (ECG, vitals)  
- **Uses**: arrhythmia detection, activity recognition, calorie and stress estimation  
- **Insight**: large LLMs can ground numeric health data with minimal examples

## 4. Validation Datasets for Clinical AI

Clinical deployment needs rigorous testing on real-world cases:

1. **NEJM Clinicopathologic Cases**  
   - 143 puzzles (2021–2024), scored by Bond Score (0–5) and Likert (0–2)  
2. **NEJM Healer Series**  
   - 20 cases, four stages: triage, exam, tests, management; R-IDEA rubric (0–10)  
3. **Grey Matters Management**  
   - 5 scenarios, 100-point rubric; compares GPT-4 vs physicians with and without AI  
4. **MIMIC-IV-Ext Clinical Decision Making**  
   - 2 400 ED visits for abdominal pain; diagnoses: appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis  
5. **Probabilistic Reasoning Challenges**  
   - Bayesian inference tasks with lab results; evaluate error in probability estimates

## 5. Deployment Considerations

Safe clinical use requires:

- **Privacy**  
  - De-identify data, encrypt records  
- **Generalization**  
  - Test on diverse hospitals and patient groups  
- **Explainability**  
  - Provide attention maps, saliency scores, counterfactuals  
- **Regulation**  
  - Define liability, follow FDA and CE guidelines

## 6. Next Steps and Future Directions

1. **Expand modalities**: add genomics, proteomics, wearable data  
2. **Real-time AI**: integrate into EHRs for live decision support  
3. **Personalization**: fine-tune on individual patient histories  
4. **Unified benchmarks**: cover performance, safety, fairness  

Multimodal LLMs can revolutionize healthcare, but careful validation and deployment are key to patient safety and trust.
