  author={Sadanandan, Binesh and Behzadan, Vahid},
  journal={Under Review},
  year={2024},
  abstract={We hypothesize that integrating data-driven PBPK modeling with RL-based decision support systems can significantly improve the precision and efficacy of cancer treatments. By personalizing therapy regimens and optimizing dosing strategies, we aim to enhance treatment outcomes, reduce toxicities, and offer a more targeted approach to cancer therapy.}
